# Principia Rithmatica
A collaborative effort to make 2D game based on the book "The Rithmatist" by Brandon Sanderson

# About
Some people on the 17th Shard thought a Rithmatist video game would be really cool, cause we're all a bunch of nerds who like good literature. There's already a few fledgling Rithmatist projects out there, but none seem to be particularly user-friendly or complete. This is meant to be a long term project (since we all have limited free time) that we can all work on in our free time, so please use good git practices. 

The project so far, is going to use Godot with a mix of GDScript (for menus and simpler node handling) and C# (for the more complicated geometry algorithms). I've included a notes/ directory, where we can share ideas or samples of how to do various things.
